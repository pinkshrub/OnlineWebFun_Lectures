## Introduction

This Repository serves as a hub for teaching materials for the Online web fundamentals course. Contained inside of it are a variety of tools that I find helpful to quickly navigate to relevant material, such as:
- lecture outlines
- supporting materials
- calendars that describe a rough trajectory of topics
- "topical" gists
- resources for learning more
- Admin documents

Much of the work in this repository is from previous instructors that have taught this course previously. Many Thanks to Todd, Michael, Sarah, and Jonathan for starting all of this.
