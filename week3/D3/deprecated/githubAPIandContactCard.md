- **Resources...**
  - GitHub API documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/
  - GitHub's Root Endpoint: `https://api.github.com`
    - All requests emanate from this base URL
    - A specific user is at the route: `https://api.github.com/users/:username`
      - e.g. `https://api.github.com/users/TEnders64`
- Follow Contact Card wireframe http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/12/3027/16877
- Add another form with input for GitHub username
- On form submit, query GitHub's API to retrieve that user's data
- Display the retrieved data like your other contact cards
- When you're done, post your code in a new repo on GitHub!
- Super meta.
