#### Javascript Advanced Concepts

#### Scoping

- Variables come in two scopes, global and local

```js
  var iAmAGlobalVariable = 'Everyone sees me!';

  function tester(){
    console.log(iAmAGlobalVariable);
    var localVariable = 'I was created inside';
  }

  console.log(localVariable);
```
- The location that the variable gets defined in determines what it has access to. By location I mean the function, or lack of, where the variable was defined.

#### Closures

- Closures are simply inner functions having access to the outer function's variables.
```js
function parent(){
  var cookiesInTheJar = 50000;

  function getCookieCount(){
    console.log(cookiesInTheJar);
  }

  function childEatsCookies(){
    cookiesInTheJar--;

    getCookieCount();
  }

  return childEatsCookies;
}

var eatMoreCookies = parent();

eatMoreCookies();
```



#### Hoisting
 ```js
 console.log(x);
 console.log(noSuchVariable);
 var x = 20;
 ```
 - In "normal" languages (including Python), the program breaks if you try to call upon a variable that isn't yet set.
 - Oh no not so with Javascript!
 - JS "hoists" all variable declarations to the very very top of the file.
 ```js
 var x; 	//implicitly and invisibly occurs

 console.log(x);
 console.log(noSuchVariable);
 var x = 20;
 ```
  - This can be tricky, especially when dealing with functions!

 ```js
 var bestFood = "cotton candy";

 function returnFood() {
	 console.log(bestFood);
	 bestFood = "elephant ears";
	 console.log(bestFood);
	 return bestFood;
 }
 ```
  - Functions are "hoisted" as well!\*

 ```js
 sayHi();
 hey();

 function sayHi(){ 			//named function *declaration*
	 console.log('hi!');
 }

 var hey = function (){ 	//anonymous function *expression*
	 console.log('hey there!')
 }


 ```
 \*only if they are created by declaration, **not** if they are created by function expression


 #### Functions in Objects
  - Function Declarations vs Function Expressions
  - Declarations are the "normal" way we're used to seeing functions defined:
  ```js
  function someFunc(){
 	 //code goes here
  }

  //invoked by:
  someFunc();
  ```
  - Very similar to how we use 'var' to declare a variable, we use 'function' to _declare_ a function.
  - But functions can also be created via Expression!
   - by assigning a function to a variable
   - or assigning a function as a property of an object

  ```js
 var aFunction = function(){
 	console.log("this is part of a function expression")
 }
 //invoked by:
 aFunction();

 var myObj = {
 	myFunction : function(){
 		console.log("this is my function which lives inside an object!")
 	}
 }
 //invoked by:
 myObj.myFunction(); //think about jQuery's dot methods!
  ```

#### Callbacks
- You can pass functions as parameters into other functions
- Then you can call it whenever you want to

```js
  function outer(first, last){
    first();
    console.log('then');
    last();
  }
  function callbackA(){
    console.log('A');
  }
  function callbackB(){
    console.log('B');
  }
```

#### Recursion
 - Sometimes, functions call other functions. Other times, functions call themselves!
 - When a function calls itself, that is _recursion_.
 - Doesn't that lead to a infinite loop? Yes.
 - Unless:
  - Each function call takes you closer to your goal
  - That goal is set up as a 'break case', which **breaks** you out of the loop

 ```js
 function infiniteLoop(){ 			//poor computer!
	 infiniteLoop(); 					// the function calls itself
 }
 function brokenLoop(num){ 		//how many times will this run?
	 console.log(num);
	 if (num < 1) { //break case
		 console.log('broke out!');
		 return; 						//this return pops us out of our current function call
	 }
	 brokenLoop(num - 1); 			// the function calls itself
 }

 brokenLoop(3);
 ```  


#### Immediate Functions
 - Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE, pronounced "iffy")
 - Offers the security and privacy of scoping without taking up a name
 - Putting the whole function inside (parens) makes it an expression the same way assigning it to a variable does
 - Invoking that function right away with the () means it doesn't wait to get called by anything else; it hits the gates running.

 ```js
 (function(){
	var private = "i am only accessible from within my function's scope"
	console.log(private);
 })();
 console.log(private);

 ```
