####Administrative
- Take/retake and pass the yellow belt exam
- Finish Pacman
- Will be code reviewing Pacman this week. Pacman should be pushed on git in the organization
- Delay-- still getting through contact card

####Git
- Request an invite from one of us (post on chat during lecture)
- Go to web fund organization [Organization](https://github.com/CodingDojoOnline-Web-Fundamentals)
- Create a new repo FirstnameLastname (SaraWong)
- Create a folder locally, cd (change directory) to the folder
- `git init` to initialize repository
- `mkdir pacman` to create a pacman folder
- `cd pacman` move into pacman folder
- `touch index.html` create an html file where your pacman code will go
- Follow the video on the Pacman assignment to get started building Pacman
- It may be challenging and may take some extra time. Break it down and get smaller functionality working and add your features incrementally.

####Code review steps
- Add a folder to your repository
- Push your updated folder (i.e., SaraWong) to GitHub
- We will clone, commit some recommendations, and push on top of your repo
- You can view the recommendations by clicking on 'commits' and finding the commit added by one of the instructors

####Collaboration
- Become a collaborator on a repository, or fork and create a pull request.
- The former is a quick and dirty collab method for smaller teams that don't require a single code gatekeeper.
- The latter is how most project work is done, takes longer (due to a gatekeeper deciding which pull requests to accept) but tends to make for more stable and controlled code. It is particularly helpful on open source projects where you require help from other other, anonymous developers so you don't have to manage access (via collaborators) and you don't trust just anyone to commit on top of your working code.

####Cloning
- Pull all the code from a remote repository, and create a 'clone' on your computer.
- As long as you are the owner or you are given access as a 'collaborator' on the repository, you can add, commit, and push to the same repository.

####Forking
- When you create a fork, you are creating a copy/clone of the original but it exists on GitHub at first, not on your computer.
- To put it on your computer, `git clone` the copy repository.
- Add, commit, and push to the copy repository.
- To request that your updated code is pulled into the original, click on 'Create pull request' on the copy repository (GitHub).
- The other user will see the changes, and choose to accept or decline your pull request.
