####Where Does The Web Start?
- It's all just a bunch of connected computers
- All we are doing is sending out requests to different addresses (where computers live)
  - Those computers are executing logic based on our requests to deliver pages/data back to us

####Languages Browsers Speak
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

####HTML
- HyperText Markup Language
  - Just a type of language contained in a document that a browser can read
  - Determines the structure of the page
- Tags get interpreted as content
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares that this is an html5 document. Use this always.
  - `<html>` starts a document and the corresponding `</html>` ends it
  - `<head>` contains information about the page
  - `<body>` contains the content displayed
- Most-used tags are on the learning platform.  
  - We teach the <b>20%</b> that builds the <b>80%</b> of sites
  - What's nytimes.com made up of? Nothing crazy!
